# Biometric Speech Recognition System

### A biometric system for person identification by voice recognition

##### This project was developed for *Bases of Biometry* classes at Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics faculty of Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. It took approximately 2 days to accomplish. Although three people participated in the project, the software was made only by me.

## How it works

- Firstly, the user must register by filling first name and last name input fields and then clicking the *REGISTER VOICE SAMPLE* button.
- Then the text appears and user must read it.
- After reading the text user must click the *FINISH* button.

From this moment user is registered in the system (a file with recorded voice sample is saved in project file system - `sounds` folder).

- User identification can be done by clicking the *CHECK VOICE* button.
- Text to read appears.
- User reads the text and clicks the *FINISH* button.
- Information about identified person and its propability is presented to the user.

Fragments of *The Snow Queen* by **Hans Christian Andersen** (Polish translation) was used as a text. Feel free to change that in `text/text.txt` file
